# Version History - Produce Processing App

## v1.17 (2026-02-05)
**UX Update: Removed Undo Confirmation**

### Changed:
- Removed confirmation dialog from Undo button in completed items
- Previously clicking Undo showed "Are you sure?" popup
- Now clicking Undo immediately restores the item

### Before:
```
Click [↶ Undo] → Popup: "Undo completion for 'Bananas #1234'?" 
                 → Click OK → Item restored
```

### After:
```
Click [↶ Undo] → Item restored immediately
```

### Why:
- Faster workflow
- Less friction for quick corrections
- Undo action is reversible anyway (can mark complete again)
- One-click operation
