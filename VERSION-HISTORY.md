# Version History - Produce Processing App

## v1.18 (2026-02-05)
**UX Update: Removed All Done Confirmation**

### Changed:
- Removed confirmation dialog from "All Done" button
- Previously clicking "All Done" showed "Mark as completed?" popup
- Now clicking "All Done" immediately marks item complete

### Before:
```
Click [All Done] → Popup: "Mark 'Bananas #1234' as completed?" 
                  → Click OK → Item marked complete
```

### After:
```
Click [All Done] → Item marked complete immediately
```

### Why:
- Faster workflow for completing items
- Less friction - one click instead of two
- Consistent with Undo button (v1.17)
- Action is reversible via Undo button anyway
