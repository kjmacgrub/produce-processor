# Version History - Produce Processing App

## v1.15 (2026-02-05)
**UI Update: Completed Items Summary**

### Changed:
- Completed items summary now shows cases out of total cases
- Previously showed "cases completed of X items"
- Now shows "cases completed of Y total cases"

### Before:
```
Completed Items
50 cases completed of 5 items
```

### After:
```
Completed Items
50 cases completed of 100 total cases
```

### Why:
- More meaningful comparison
- Shows completion percentage clearly
- Example: "50 of 100 total cases" = 50% done
- Example: "50 of 5 items" = unclear progress
